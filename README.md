# Human-Authentication-using-Forehead
Built a computer vision based forehead based human authentication on mobile and hand held devices. Used traditional SIFT, SURF, ORB, ArcFace, and AKAZE algorithms to calculate matching scores between CLAHE preprocessed images. Achieved an average accuracy of 59.99%, and best accuracy of 73.997% using the ArcFace algorithm.
